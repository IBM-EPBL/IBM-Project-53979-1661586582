# CSCI 571 HW6 - NewsApp

This is a web news app uisng HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the frontend and Python (Flask) for the backend. News API is used for news sources. 

The app shows a carousel of headlines with a word cloud of some top keywords in the news' titles. Four headlines from both CNN and Fox News are shown below. Clicking on the Search tab reveals a search form for the user to look up news based on keyword, date, category, and source.

The Flask backend is served on Google Cloud Platform and serves as a middleware between the frontend web app and the News API. Therefore News API is not directly called from the frontend.
